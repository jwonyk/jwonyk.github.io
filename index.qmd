My name is Jay Kim (she/her), a researcher passionate about food systems with a background in Psychology and East Asian studies from UC Irvine. From managing my familyâ€™s business during pandemic supply chain disruptions to supporting seniors in my community, I found a deep commitment to using data for community impact. Iâ€™ve applied analytics to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and explore climate justice research, and Iâ€™m committed to building equitable, sustainable food systems where everyone has access to what they need.
