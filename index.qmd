My name is Jay Kim (she/her), a researcher passionate about food systems with a background in Psychology and East Asian studies from UC Irvine. From managing my family’s business during pandemic supply chain disruptions to supporting seniors in my community, I found a deep commitment to using data for community impact. I’ve applied analytics to reduce waste, improve efficiency, and explore climate justice research, and I’m committed to building equitable, sustainable food systems where everyone has access to what they need.
